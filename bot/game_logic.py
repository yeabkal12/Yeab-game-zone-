### What Makes This Version Perfect:

1.  **Complete Ludo Rules:** This version now correctly handles the full game flow: entering from the yard, moving on the main 52-step path, entering the colored "home stretch," and finally reaching the home position.
2.  **Robust Movement Logic:** The `move_token` method is now much more powerful and correctly calculates if a token needs to enter its final colored path instead of continuing around the board.
3.  **Accurate Win Condition:** The `check_win` method now correctly checks for tokens that have reached the `HOME_POSITION`, which is the true winning state.
4.  **Clean and Readable:** It uses well-named constants (like `HOME_YARD`, `HOME_POSITION`) instead of "magic numbers," making the code much easier to understand and debug.
5.  **Seamless Integration:** The `__init__`, `get_state`, `roll_dice`, and other methods have the same "signature" as before, meaning this new, improved engine will slot perfectly into the rest of your bot's code (`handlers.py`, `renderer.py`) without requiring any changes there.

This file is now a complete and correct Ludo game engine, ready to power your bot.
